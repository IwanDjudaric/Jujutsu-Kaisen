            Masked Crusader: he is the guy who killed Ben Reilly's uncle. But he got his own resons. His son is sick and
            his wife was brutally murdered. So he needed money to save his son,
            and he started to work as a killer. Someone ordered to kill Ben, because he saw something that he should've
            never seen.
